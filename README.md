# RaspberryPiNight
At Raspberry Pi Night, we use Raspberry Pis, Arduinos and similar devices in miniprojects lasting a few weeks each.  Each project starts from scratch and builds on previous weeks, so we can go into some depth for each project, but there is always a new project starting within a few weeks so people can join in at any time.  The projects will involve programming Pis, using sensors and motors, interfacing with Bluetooth or wifi, some basic electronics soldering, etc.  If you think of a project you'd like us to do, bring your idea and it might be the next project!  We also have a week or two between projects for general Raspberry Pi help, so bring your new Pi and we'll help.
